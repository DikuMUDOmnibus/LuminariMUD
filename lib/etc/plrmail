i changed the code so you can have one follower/pet regardless of charisma score..
but normally you can only have followers equal to your charisma bonus, otherwise
they will turn on you...

I got your suggestion/idea about switching practice/train.  I'm definitely in
favor of the idea.  Its actually a fairly big switch at first glance, but I'm
going to add it to my 'wish-list.'  I prioritize basic mechanics and bug-fixes
at this stage though, so it may be a bit before I get to it.
Thanks so much for your input :)

Re:  Torches and Light Sources

So this whole issue with light sources and torches is actually a topic I haven't
finalized as far as gameplay.  At the current time you can just nab a permanent
light source from one of the newbie zones and be done with the whole system of
torches burning out, etc.

But if its so easy to get a light source that is permanent, why even have light
sources except for novelty?  :p

Anyhow I transferred your 'bug' to the forum on the website (www.luminarimud.com)
to try and get the community to express an opinion as we develop.

re:  pets and teleporters
The teleporter system is actually a temporary system of getting around until
our zones are attached properly...

I apologize for the inconvenience it causes :(

re: treat injury
yessir, treat injury over-inflates hps...  i haven't decided whether its staying that
way, but I coded it that way to make it easier on players during testing phase :)

bug/idea reports

yeah the mace vaprak gave you was flagged to stun you permanently
i'm sure he did it by mistake
be careful what you accept stuff from :P  hahah
but seriously, sorry about the trouble, i changed the mace and took it off
your character, just ask vaprak to reload it for you next time you see him
it should be fixed
... maybe it'd be smart to have me load it for you in case there are any issues :P

help zones is how you know what keywords to use with your teleporter

in the future those details will be hidden, but we are in a testing phase so
we want our players to access everything easily right now
~
### 52 1 1352576582
i implemented the ability to 'exam' things while resting/sitting
i also fixed the other things you pointed out, and some of your suggestions
are good but I have to prioritize other things right now...  i noted your
ideas as all resolved and moved the ones I haven't implemented yet to the website
idea list

thanks so much for your input!

Hey Dredd! I need you to help me with a heist. It concerns that very wealthy guy. If you can put him to sleep or something equally useful I'll steal his equipment. I'll give you some of the armor if you do.

with our current system, a command is required because of multi-classing
example, if you are a mage/cleric
you'd type rest
but i wouldn't know which spell list to recover

please let me know if this addressed your idea request or not

re:  resize glasses large

to resize an item, you will need a crafting kit (you should have started with one,
if you lost it, you can buy it in sanctus, down and north from the temple)

place the item in the kit you want resized

type:  resize <new size>
so in your example:
put glasses kit
resize large

re:  cooldown on call mount

i couldn't think of a reason why a cooldown should be replaced with a long
summoning time...  so i rejected the idea...  if there is a good reason
though, please repost on the website forum for discussion

re:  help files containing levels

Its a great idea, and I initially did it, but I found it problematic
so early in development because we are constantly shifting spells
around as we are balancing the new system...

Eventually its our goal to have that info either in a help file
or in a command...

Thanks for all your great ideas/bug reports, its help us a lot

re: helpfiles

i don't have a list, i think my original plan was to play through
a bit and see what helpfiles we need, but i'm happy with what
we got...

anything else you think we need to get done before i pack up
the early-beta version of our code?
