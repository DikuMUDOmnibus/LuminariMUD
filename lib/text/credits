LuminariMUD

Luminari was developed from various version of CircleMUD starting in 1999(?).
The MUD has undergone multiple ports and transition from various versions/
bases through the years and has spent most of her time on the shelf due to
military/work/family committments by the developers.

Unfortunately not all the contributors of code can be properly thanked for
contributions to the MUD.  We do know, that outside of our original code
the sources of inspirtation and snippets vary from various incarnations of
dikuMUD and the circleMUD mailing list back when it was active.

We obviously mean to include all contributing parties, and if you feel you
belong on this list, just let us know and we'll put you where you belong.

All the 'legal stuff' is also in this file.  Area credits has been added
to the 'zlist' command to reflect the most accuracy.

+++ Other Sources of Inspiration +++
     We are EXTREMELY greateful for all our builders and play-testers that help
us truly refine the MUD through her development.
     We've always had special influence from the variuos Dungeons and Dragons
campaigns, espeically Dragonlance and Forgotten Realms.  Our game mechanics are
heavily influenced by Dungeons and Dragons.  Its our passionate opinion that the
entity DnD its various forms doesn't get enough credit from the MUD community.
     Our "style" and "feel" are heavily influenced by various MUDs we've played
through-out the years, such as:  Realms of Aurealis, Toril, Sojourn, Duris,
Basternae, Home-land, GreyhawkMUD and too many more to even remember.
     We've included also credits to CWG, we took (or were inspired by) a limited
amount of code from the great project.  Also to Gicker and the rest of the staff
involved with the d20MUD project.
     The Bioware game series Neverwinter Nights was a big influence, and some of
the manual's material was used for our helpfiles.  Also the NWN2 Wiki and d20
SRD website helped out a lot for reference.
     Another special thanks and mention is due to those that started it all - to
those that pre-date circle/dikuMUD in the line of inspiration.

Jeremy "Ras" Elson at Johns Hopkins University's Department of Computer Science.
All code unique to tbaMUD is protected under a copyright by the Trustees of 
the Johns Hopkins University.

Many, many people contributed to tbaMUD in one way or another throughout
the course of its development.  Although it is impossible for me to remember
them all, I'd like to extend special thanks to certain people:

  -- Jeff Fink and George Greer, for submitting a veritable mountain of
     excellent code.
  -- Chris Epler and Chris Herringshaw for extensive beta-testing and bug
     reporting.
  -- Furry (Alex Fletcher), for single-handedly managing Circle's world files.
  -- Fred Merkel, Ryan Watkins, Jay Levino, and Sharon Goza, for other
     code and area submissions.
  -- Jean-Jack Riethoven for porting the code to the Amiga, David Carver
     for porting it to OS/2, and Jack Patton and Steffen Haeuser for the
     Amiga port.
  -- Bill Bogstad and Tim Stearns for allowing Circle to exist at JHU.
  -- The DikuMUD folk, and the good old WhatMUD implementors Dave & Justin,
     for starting the ball rolling.
  -- Bryan Jolson, Steven Lacher, Cat Stanton, and Naved Surve, for being 
     there in the very early days of Circle's development.
  -- Sharon, Ben, Erica, Aly, and Josh, for keeping me sane.
  -- Jules (hamotek sheli) for being the greatest.

...plus everyone else in the Circle community who has submitted material!
Thanks everyone!

Jeremy Elson

CircleMUD is licensed software. This file contains the text of the CircleMUD license. 
If you wish to use the CircleMUD system in any way, or use any of its source code, 
you must read this license and are legally bound to comply with it. 

CircleMUD is a derivative work based on the DikuMUD system written by Hans Henrik 
Staerfeldt, Katja Nyboe, Tom Madsen, Michael Seifert, and Sebastian Hammer. DikuMUD 
is also licensed software; you are legally bound to comply with the original DikuMUD 
license as well as the CircleMUD license if you wish to use CircleMUD. 

Use of the CircleMUD code in any capacity implies that you have read, understood, and 
agreed to abide by the terms and conditions set down by this license and the DikuMUD 
license. If you use CircleMUD without complying with the license, you are breaking 
the law. 

Using CircleMUD legally is easy. In short, the license requires three things: 


You must not use CircleMUD to make money or be compensated in any way. 
You must give the authors credit for their work. 
You must comply with the DikuMUD license. 
That's it -- those are the main conditions set down by this license. Unfortunately, 
past experience has shown that many people are not willing to follow the spirit of 
the license, so the remainder of this document will clearly define those conditions 
in an attempt to prevent people from circumventing them. 

The first condition says that you must not use CircleMUD to make money in any way or 
be otherwise compensated. CircleMUD was developed in people's uncompensated spare 
time and was given to you free of charge, and you must not use it to make money. 
CircleMUD must not in any way be used to facilitate your acceptance of fees, 
donations, or other compensation. Examples include, but are not limited to the 
following: 


If you run CircleMUD, you must not require any type of fee or donation in exchange 
for being able to play CircleMUD. You must not solicit, offer or accept any kind of 
donation from your players in exchange for enhanced status in the game such as 
increased levels, character stats, gold, or equipment. 

You must not solicit or accept money or other donations in exchange for running 
CircleMUD. You must not accept money or other donations from your players for 
purposes such as hardware upgrades for running CircleMUD. 

You must not sell CircleMUD. You must not accept any type of fee in exchange for 
distributing or copying CircleMUD. 

If you are a CircleMUD administrator, You must not accept any type of reimbursement 
for money spent out of pocket for running CircleMUD, i.e., for equipment expenses or 
fees incurred from service providers. 

The second part of the license states that you must give credit to the creators of 
CircleMUD. A great deal of work went into the creation of CircleMUD, and it was given 
to you completely free of charge; claiming that you wrote the MUD yourself is a slap 
in the face to everyone who worked to bring you a high quality product while asking 
for nothing but credit for their work in return. 
Specifically, the following are required: 


The text in the 'credits' file distributed with CircleMUD must be preserved. You may 
add your own credits to the file, but the existing text must not be removed, 
abridged, truncated, or changed in any way. This file must be displayed when the 
'credits' command is used from within the MUD. 

The "CIRCLEMUD" help entry must be maintained intact and unchanged, and displayed in 
its entirety when the 'help circlemud' command is used. 

The login sequence must contain the names of the DikuMUD and CircleMUD creators. The 
'login sequence' is defined as the text seen by players between the time they connect 
to the MUD and when they start to play the game itself. 

This license must be distributed AS IS with all copies or portions of the CircleMUD 
that you distribute, if any, including works derived from CircleMUD. 

You must not remove, change, or modify any notices of copyright, licensing or 
authorship found in any CircleMUD source code files. 

Claims that any of the above requirements are inapplicable to a particular MUD for 
reasons such as "our MUD is totally rewritten" or similar are completely invalid. If 
you can write a MUD completely from scratch then you are encouraged to do so by all 
means, but use of any part of the CircleMUD or DikuMUD source code requires that 
their respective licenses be followed, including the crediting requirements. 

The third part of the license simply states that you must comply with the DikuMUD 
license. This is required because CircleMUD is a DikuMUD derivative. The DikuMUD 
license is included below. 
You are allowed to use, modify and redistribute all CircleMUD source code and 
documentation as long as such use does not violate any of the rules set down by this 
license.

This document contains the rules by which you can use, alter or publish
parts of DikuMud. DikuMud has been created by the above five listed persons
in their spare time, at DIKU (Computer Science Instutute at Copenhagen
University). You are legally bound to follow the rules described in this
document.

Rules:

   !! DikuMud is NOT Public Domain, shareware, careware or the like !!

   You may under no circumstances make profit on *ANY* part of DikuMud in
   any possible way. You may under no circumstances charge money for
   distributing any part of dikumud - this includes the usual $5 charge
   for "sending the disk" or "just for the disk" etc.
   By breaking these rules you violate the agreement between us and the
   University, and hence will be sued.

   You may not remove any copyright notices from any of the documents or
   sources given to you.

   This license must *always* be included "as is" if you copy or give
   away any part of DikuMud (which is to be done as described in this
   document).

   If you publish *any* part of dikumud, we as creators must appear in the
   article, and the article must be clearly copyrighted subject to this
   license. Before publishing you must first send us a message, by
   snail-mail or e-mail, and inform us what, where and when you are
   publishing (remember to include your address, name etc.)

   If you wish to setup a version of DikuMud on any computer system, you
   must send us a message , by snail-mail or e-mail, and inform us where
   and when you are running the game. (remember to include 
   your address, name etc.)


   Any running version of DikuMud must include our names in the login
   sequence. Furthermore the "credits" command shall always cointain
   our name, addresses, and a notice which states we have created DikuMud.

   You are allowed to alter DikuMud, source and documentation as long as
   you do not violate any of the above stated rules.


Regards,



The DikuMud Group


Note:

We hope you will enjoy DikuMud, and encourage you to send us any reports
on bugs (when you find 'it'). Remember that we are all using our spare
time to write and improve DikuMud, bugs, etc. - and changes will take their
time. We have so far put extremely many programming hours into this project.
If you make any major improvements on DikuMud we would be happy to
hear from you. As you will naturally honor the above rules, you will receive
new updates and improvements made to the game.
