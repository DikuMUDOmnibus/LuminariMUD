As the Philistine looked around, he caught sight of David and scorned him, because
he was just a young lad, ruddy and handsome.

     He roared at David, "Am I a dog, that you come at me with sticks?!"  The
Philistine cursed David by his gods and then said to David, "Come on, you, come to
me!  I'll make mincemeat out of you for the birds of the sky and the beasts of the
field!"

     So David responded to the Philistine, "You come against me with a sword, a
spear, and a javelin, but I come against you in the Name of the Lord of Hosts, G-d
of the ranks of Israel, Whom you have blashphemed.  Today G-d will deliver you into
my hands; today I will kill you.  I will remove your head from your body, and
present the carcass of the Philistine camp as carrion for the birds of the sky and 
the beasts of the field.  All the land will know that there is a G-d in Israel!
And this whole encampment gathered here will know that it is not by sword or spear 
that G-d saves, for the battle is already His.  He will deliver you into our hands."
