wraith~
a mournful wraith~
A mournful wraith hovers in and out of existance.
~
   Faceless and featureless, the only that can be seen about this entity is the
vague outline of a humanoid figure.  Glowing faintly, it nonetheless appears the
darkest thing in the room.

gigantic ice dragon~
@Ca gigantic ice dragon@n~
@CA gigantic ice dragon@c stands guard over the castle.
~
   Huge and intimidating, this dragon is covered in massive armour-plated
scales, shimmering all different hues of crystal and ice.  Large scaley limbs
stand firmly against the ground, tipped with razor-sharp claws and encrusted
with snow as if the dragon has almost become part of the architecture.  His
steely eyes are bright but cold, glimmering with a strange blue fire.

pale queen~
@Ca pale queen@n~
@CA pale queen@c gazes forlornly towards the east.
~
   Her smooth, delicate features were probably naturally pale, but now her skin
is tinged with an eerie blue hue.  Her sorrowful eyes linger on the eastern side
of the room as if she were longing for some place she can no longer reach.  Her
dress merges with the floor in a flowing train of ice, rooting her to the spot
for all eternity.

white-haired king~
@Ca white-haired king@c~
@CA white-haired king@c gazes thoughtfully toward the west.
~
   Old and sorrowful in appearance, this man's thick white hair is part his own
and part crystals of snow.  His face is haggard and morose, his eyes filled with
a silent longing as he gazes toward the western part of the room.  The lower
part of his body has turned almost completely into ice, rendering him a statue
in his own abode.

icy princess~
@Can icy princess@n~
@CAn icy princess@c stands frozen to the spot.
~
   This young girl has smooth white skin like moon-cream, silver blonde hair
tumbling down her back, glittering with snow crystals.  Her eyes are large and
sorrowful, a deep azure blue paled and sparkling with a misty glaze of ice.  A
fine sheen of frozen droplets covers her gown, studding it with crystals as if
bejewelled.
