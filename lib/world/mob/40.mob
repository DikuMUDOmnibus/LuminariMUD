snake large~
the snake~
A large dreadful snake is at your feet, hissing at you.
~
   This heavy-bodied snake is about 5 feet long.  It is gray with black
crossbands that are chevron-shaped.  These rattlesnakes are generally passive if
not disturbed or pestered in some way.  When a rattlesnake is encountered, the
safest reaction is to back away -- it will not try to attack you if you leave it
alone.
