Half completed, an experimental android stands here, de-activated.
~
   The android was never completed and therefore, has no gender.  It has 2 legs,
a torso, a head and an eletronic mind, but lacks any arms.  It wears no clothes
and only has a half-finished skin-implant.  Because of this, the android looks
spotched with a disease.  Where the skin failed to cover, silvery mechanical
parts and micro-chips can be seen.  It is currently de-activated but can be
re-activated by pressing a switch up behind it's left shoulder-blade.
