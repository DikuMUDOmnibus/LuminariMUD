hopelessness feeling~
a feeling of hopelessness~
A feeling of hopelessness threatens to overcome you.
~
   Depression, hopelessness, fear and anxiety all come together to try and bring
you down.  They threaten to overcome and overpower you.  Seperately, each is a
dangerous foe, but together they are near unstoppable.  Perhaps, before they
grow any more in numbers, or torment your soul any further you should just kill
yourself and end your pain.

mist~

it forces you to wield whatever weapons are at your disposal and defend
yourself.
