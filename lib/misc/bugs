Text      Problems with Price Selling / Appraise / Charisma~
Body      Occasionally, it seems that getting raises in the appraise skill -- either through direct raises or raising my intelligence -- sometimes lowers the prices I get for selling stuff. Moreover, the same effect happens with charisma. It doesn't seem quite consistent across the board as sometimes I do get favorable prices. But often the proper relationship is inverted.

Text      continual flame in the dark~
Body      Trying to cast 'continual flame' in a room that's too dark (shouldn't my infravision take care of that anyway?) Evidently the room is too dark for me to find the flame. If I go to a brighter area, I can find the flame again.

Text      wizard scribing~
Body      For some reason it tells me that the scroll with cause light wound i have been trying to scribe is for a spell that does not exist. 
If as i'm assuming it is because it is a divine spell then it should probably say something about that to the player.
