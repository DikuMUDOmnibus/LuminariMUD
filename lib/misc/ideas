Text      paging interruption~
Body      Let me know if you want this on the forums instead.  When you are viewing a
help, or a long list with zlist or mlist or whatever, you have to specifically
hit q to stop.  I propose that ANY input other than return, R, or B, count as Q
and exit the paging.

group leader should add people.  You shouldn't be able to join a group, or some
pvp craziness will ensue.

Text      Levelup interface~
Body      I suggest a single command that handles all the levelup stuff, including
class, boost, prac, train, spells, and whatever else.  It would provide you with
a numbered list of all the options you need to handle, and each line would turn
from yellow to green as you completed that section.  It would limit your ability
to do it on the fly from the command line, but it'd be a lot more friendly.  It
would have to automatically omit options that don't apply, like no boost like if
you have no points, or spell line if you have no spells.

Text      Epic-races suggestion~
Body      No one knows exactly how these strange creatures came into being. Some suggest 
that it was perhaps the curse of a god, the spell of a powerful mage or perhaps 
even the inadvertent result of a farmer and his favorite cow. What is known 
however, is that minotaurs are one of the fiercest humanoid creatures in Lumina. 
Although not numerous as a species, they make their presence felt where ever 
they live. Standing at around 10 feet tall with their huge muscles bulging and 
their sharp horns gleaming, they are truly an awesome sight to behold. There 
are few minotaur settlements in Lumina, but they are typically found on the 
plains. Society in these settlements is controlled by a martial code of law, 
often ruled by the clan leader and his hunters. Minotaurs usually remain aloof 
from the world in general, considering many races to be weak and despising most 
magic users as a rule. As a true warrior race, most minotaurs excel as Warrior,berserker
and rangers, gaining an edge through their animal instincts.

Text      quests~
Body      When creating quests, it shows description at the name.  I think it would look
better if the quest name was listed when the command quest list is used.  A
simple command "quest info" could show the description without actually joining
the quest.  Also, I don't think quest rewards should be affected by happy hour
bonuses.
